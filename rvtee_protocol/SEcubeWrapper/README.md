# SEcubeWrapper
C++ Wrapper for SEcube L0/L1 Host Libraries

# L0 and L1 DLL building instructions
1. Run the `build.bat` script.
2. Built dlls are found in the `lib` directory.

# SEcube Source
The L0 and L1 wrappers are designed compatible with version 1.5.0, which can be
obtained from the [official SEcube website](https://www.secube.eu/resources/open-sources-sdk/). The source code has been slightly modified as originally
some directories contained *spaces*; These were removed to achieve simpler
build commands.
